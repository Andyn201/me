        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>

                Learning to code is thrilling and rewarding, but also confusing. I remember asking myself all sorts of questions. Which language should I learn? What should I build? Where should I go to learn?

                That is why I created this comprehensive, step-by-step guide. It should make learning code much easier and less frustrating. 
                

        </p>


        <h3>Before You Start</h3>


        <p>

                Coding is about building things. It is about creating cool and useful software. That means the first thing you should do is figure out what you want to build. Pick a niche to keep things simple. You can branch out as you learn more. 

                Do you want to build websites?
                
                Do you to build mobile apps?
                
                Do you want to get into Data Science and Machine Learning?
                
                Do you want to build games?
                

        </p>


        <h3> 1. Pick Your Languages</h3>


        <p>

                There are countless programming languages out there. It is impossible to learn all of them. Therefore, you should only pick the languages that you absolutely need to build your projects. You can google things like “programming languages to build a website”. You can also look below to see which languages I recommend. 

                Websites
                
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL
                
                Mobile Apps
                
                Swift for IOS and Java for Android
                
                Data Science and Machine Learning
                
                    Python and R
                Games 
                
                    HTML, CSS, Javascript for IO games
                
                Note: You can use other languages to build all these things. I chose these because I think they are the easiest to learn.
                

        </p>


        <h3>2. Learn The Syntax Of Each Language</h3>

        <p>
                Just like learning a language like Spanish, coding languages have a structure to them. You can’t give speeches without knowing how to format sentences, and the same thing is true in coding.

                There are tons of great, free resources to learn the syntax of a coding language. You can find watch youtube videos. However, the way I recommend learning is reading documentation, or coding manuals. Companies must publish documentation on the languages they create, or nobody would know the syntax. Here are some documentation sites below.
                
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">HTML, CSS Javascript</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/">Swift</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html">Java</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html">Python</a>
        <br>
        <a href=" https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">R</a>
                

        <h3>3. Start Building</h3>
  
        <p>

                After learning the ABC’s of coding, you can finally move onto building projects. You can look on Youtube and Github for inspiration. You can also come up with your own thing to build. 
                Once you build your first project, you can officially call yourself a programmer, or a person who builds software. 
                
                Building your own projects is not always easy. You will run into problems and get frustrated. Everyone, including senior developers, get stuck. It is just a part of the process.
                

        </p>  


        <h3>4. What To Do Next</h3>


        <p>

                What to do next depends entirely on you and what you want to do. If you want to do this as a hobby, just keep building projects. If you want to get a job in the industry, start putting together a portfolio to show employers and start networking. If you want to start a company, build your company. It all depends on you and what you want. 

        </p>
                
       
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
                This guide covers everything you need to get started coding. It is the guide that I wish that I could have read when I was first starting. Go through the steps I provided above, and you should be able to reach your goals. Good Luck.
